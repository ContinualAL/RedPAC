# Abstract
To increase the control autonomy in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), an increasing demand of implementing the learning or intelligent controllers is noticed in recent times. In this work, a simple evolving neuro-fuzzy system with less learning parameter is utilized to develop an intelligent controller namely Reduced Parsimonious Controller (RedPAC). The proposed RedPAC is a simplified version of one of the recently developed intelligent controller called Parsimonious Controller (PAC). In RedPAC, the network parameters are reduced into two steps. Firstly, unlike the conventional fuzzy logic or neuro-fuzzy-based intelligent controller, it has no premise parameters. Since this concept of no-premise-parameter has already been implemented in PAC, the number of consequent parameters of PAC has further reduced to one parameter per rule in RedPAC. The sliding mode control (SMC) technique is utilized to adapt the consequent parameter of RedPAC, where the SMC-based auxiliary robustifying control term is guaranteeing the uniform asymptotic convergence of tracking error to zero. The proposed controller's performance has been evaluated by implementing it to control a quadcopter UAV simulator namely Dronekit. In addition, trajectory tracking performance of RedPAC is compared against three different controllers namely a linear PID, a nonlinear SMC, and an intelligent controller called PAC. On an average, it outperforms PID and SMC techniques. Results are also comparable with regards to PAC, however, RedPAC needs comparatively less parameters to obtain a similar or better tracking accuracy.
